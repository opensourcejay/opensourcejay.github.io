In the fast-moving world of multimodal AI, I wanted a lightweight way to experiment with two of the most exciting models available: **GPT-Image-1** and **Sora**. Thatâ€™s why I built **CAMEO** â€” a clean, open-source app designed to test and compare them side by side with minimal friction.

## What Is CAMEO?

**CAMEO** is a simple interface that lets you send the same input â€” whether itâ€™s an image or a prompt â€” to both GPT-Image-1 and Sora. It instantly returns both modelsâ€™ outputs for quick visual and textual comparison. No fluff, no bloated UI â€” just a streamlined experience focused on rapid iteration and exploration.

## Why I Built It

Most tools for testing AI models are either closed off, complicated, or overloaded with features you donâ€™t need. I wanted something:

- **Minimal** and easy to deploy  
- **Flexible** enough to handle image and text input  
- **Focused** on just two models Iâ€™m actively exploring  

CAMEO strips everything down to the essentials. Itâ€™s meant for tinkerers, devs, and AI enthusiasts who want to jump right in.

## Use Cases

CAMEO opens the door to a variety of quick, creative, and practical use cases:

- **Prompt Engineering:** Tweak your inputs and instantly see how GPT-Image-1 and Sora differ in response.
- **Image Understanding:** Upload an image and compare how each model interprets it.
- **Creative Workflows:** Brainstorm visual concepts, generate captions, or explore storytelling ideas.
- **Model Benchmarking:** Test GPT-Image-1 and Sora side-by-side on your own terms.
- **Educational Demos:** Great for showing off capabilities without diving into code.

## Try It Out

CAMEO is fully open-source and ready to go on GitHub:

Itâ€™s intentionally minimal, so you can clone it, plug in your API keys, and start testing in minutes.
