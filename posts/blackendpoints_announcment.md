The goal behind **BlackEndpoints** is simple: create a public-facing directory where developers, founders, and curious minds can discover APIs, tools, and services made by Black technologists.

In the tech space, we often talk about open source, inclusion, and visibility — but the actual discoverability of Black-led projects still falls short. This site is built to help solve that.

## 🌍 Inspired by the Green Book

During the Jim Crow era, Black travelers relied on a resource called the *Green Book* — a guide that listed safe places for Black people to eat, sleep, and refuel without fear. It wasn’t just a travel book — it was a lifeline. It gave Black people agency and a way to navigate an America that was actively hostile to their presence.

In a similar spirit, **BlackEndpoints** aims to be a digital map — not for safety, but for **visibility** and **empowerment** in the tech world. It’s a curated space where Black-made tools can be found, shared, and supported.

## 🚀 What It Is

**BlackEndpoints** is a static website (hosted via GitHub Pages) that highlights Black-owned or Black-created developer tools, SaaS products, APIs, and open-source libraries. The design is intentionally minimal: fast to load, easy to read, and simple to update.

Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no bloat. Just straight content.

## 🔧 Why It Exists

Black technologists are building tools that power companies and apps around the world — but many are flying under the radar. Whether it’s an API that helps with financial services or an app improving community access, these tools deserve visibility and support.

This project gives them a digital home. No sign-ups. No gatekeeping. Just links and descriptions, maintained in an open GitHub repo.

## 🛠 How to Contribute

Fork the repo and submit a pull request if you know a Black-created API, service, or tool that should be featured. Whether it’s a solo project or the backbone of a Black-led startup, it belongs here.

## 💡 The Vision

**BlackEndpoints** is a modern-day signal boost — a nod to the *Green Book* legacy, reimagined for digital builders. It doesn’t try to do too much — it just makes it easier to find us.

If you're building something and you're Black, this is where people can find you.
